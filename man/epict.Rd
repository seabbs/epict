\arguments{
\item{obs}{A data.frame with the following variables:
\itemize{
\item id: An integer vector uniquely identifying eahc infection.
\item test_id: An integer vector uniquely identiying each test
\item ct_value: Numeric cycle threshold value.
\item t: Relative (to a baseline) time of the test yielding a Ct value.
\item t_rel_uncensored: Time of test relative to the first uncensored Ct value
for that id.
\item onset_t: Relative (to a baseline) time of onset for each infection
\item onset_t_rel_uncensored: Time of onset relative to the first uncensored Ct
value for that id. (optional). NA if unavailable/asymptomatic.
\item censored: Logical, indicating if the Ct has been censored.

\item{piecewise_formula}{A list describing the piecewise linear cycle threshold
formula as described by \code{\link[=piecewise_formula]{piecewise_formula()}}.}

\item{adjustment_formula}{A list describing the cycle threshold linear
adjustment formula (shift and scale) as described by \code{\link[=adjustment_formula]{adjustment_formula()}}.}

\item{priors}{A data.table of population-level priors as produced
by \code{\link[=epict_priors]{epict_priors()}}.}

\item{model_opts}{A list of Cycle threshold model options as returned
by \code{\link[=epict_ct_model_opts]{epict_ct_model_opts()}}.}

\item{convert_to_list}{Convert observations and model settings into
a list for use in stan. Defaults to using \code{\link[=epict_convert_to_list]{epict_convert_to_list()}}.}

\item{inits}{A function that combined with a list of data returns
sample initial conditions for use during model fitting based
on model priors. Defaults to \code{\link[=epict_inits]{epict_inits()}}}

\description{
Provides a user friendly interface around package functionality
to model cycle thresholds, and symptom onsets from observed preprocessed
data, a piecewise linear model, and a linear adjustment model.
